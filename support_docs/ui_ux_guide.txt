E-Shop Checkout UI/UX Guidelines

Form and Validation
- Validation errors must be shown inline directly under the relevant input in red text (#c62828).
- Required fields should show a small helper note when left empty after a submit attempt.
- The “Payment Successful!” confirmation should be green (#1b5e20) and bold for quick scanning.

Buttons and Controls
- Primary action buttons (“Add to Cart”, “Pay Now”) should be green with white text; hover state slightly darkens.
- Disabled buttons should be gray with a not-allowed cursor.
- Radio groups should include clear labels: Shipping (Standard, Express) and Payment (Credit Card, PayPal).

Layout and Typography
- Use a clean, single-column layout for the form beside the cart summary on desktop; stack on mobile.
- Prefer a geometric sans font (e.g., “Montserrat”, “Nunito”) with at least 16px base size.
- Inputs should have generous padding and a subtle border radius for friendliness.

Messaging and Microcopy
- Error messages should be concise (e.g., “Enter a valid email address.”).
- Success messaging should reference the action (e.g., “Payment Successful!”).
- Discount code feedback should specify whether the code was applied or invalid.
